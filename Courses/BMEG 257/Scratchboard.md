Compliance devices such as alarmed pill boxes and medication dispensers have been evaluated in the literature as potential tools to improve medication adherence. Specifically, the literature commonly focuses on seniors with cognitive decline, as this population is both medically vulnerable, and typically exhibits low adherence. These active reminder devices are often paired with personalised booklets to describe medications and proper dosages, and typically achieve a high degree of success when compared to control conditions. In one such study, “medication compliance at the end of the study remained stable at 81%…compared to 66% in control.” The study noted that “as a result of using the device, medication adherence remained good, and caregiver burden was reduced,” confirming the possible value of these devices as “long-term medication management tool[s]” for older adults with cognitive decline, when paired with continued support from caregivers. In two other studies, the self-administration medication rate showed statistically significant improvement over a few months. These results posit compliance devices as an effective avenue toward increasing adherence in the identified population.
