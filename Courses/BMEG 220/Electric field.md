**Definition**: The electric force applied by the charge distribution on a test charge $q_"test"$, divided by the value of $q_"test"$, given that it is infinitesimally small. Thus,
$$arrow(E)(arrow(R)) tilde.equiv lim_(q_"test" arrow 0) (arrow(F)(arrow(R)))/q_"test"$$
where $arrow(R)$ is the displacement vector connecting the charge to the measurement point (usually P) in space.
We can thus use Coulombâ€™s Law:
$$arrow(F)(arrow(R)) = 1/(4 pi epsilon) q_"test"/abs(arrow(R))^2$$

In 3D, we often have many discrete charges producing their own electric fields. To calculate $arrow(E)$ at some point $P$ due to all discrete charges in the vicinity, we use:
$$arrow(E)_"tot" = sum_(n=1)^n E_n(arrow(R_p) - arrow(R_i))$$
