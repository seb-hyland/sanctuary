# Structure
![[Pasted image 20250110092428.png]]
- RPE cell is detection centre (collect light, greatest surface area)
- Rest of system is for transduction of visual signal to brain

>[!Important]
>The torus, or toroidal shape, is a key repeating shape in biology. The classic example is RBCs.

>[!Important]
>Rhodopsin is a light-sensitive transmembrane receptor protein on rod cells that is critical for vision
>It is present on plasma and disc membranes
>Is present at a concentration of 25,000 $"molecules" / ("Âµm"^2)$
>It has the following structure (from x-ray crystallography):

>[!Note]
>Cation exchanger channels are used for signal transduction
>Think back to Yachie!

>[!Note]
>Rhodopsin (above) has a PDB code (==1U19== for bovine strain), meaning its structure is defined and available via the **protein data bank**.
>Many important proteins are similarly available.
>This allows us to visualize it via **PyMOL**.

## Structure of Rhodopsin
- Is a **homodimer**
	- "homo" meaning same
	- "dimer" meaning two
	- Is two similar monomers which joined together to form a dimer
>[!Important]
>Thinking about o-chem is important for analyzing structure.
>When looking at ligands, we have to consider $pi$ bonds that affect or aid in stability. Double bonds may be stabilized by other bonds in the vicinity

>[!Definition]
>Retin**al**: an aldehyde
>Note the double bonded oxygen in red

### Light detection
- Light hits *cis* Retinal, and the energy causes an isomerization into *trans* Retinal - **chemical change**
- This change causes an outward force due to shape change - **physical change**
- Right outside retinal is a *helix*, which then gets shifted - **transduction**
- Converted back into **chemical change**, and cells transduce the signal via signalling
