# Eye
## Components

| Name                    | Function                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sclera                  | Covers outside of eye; preserves shape                                        |
| Cornea                  | Outside of eye in centre; refracts light                                      |
| Choroid                 | Thin layer inside sclera; contains blood/lymphatic vessels, supports drainage |
| Lens                    | Behind cornea; refracts light                                                 |
| Iris                    | Forms aperture/pupil, smooth tissue                                           |
| Ciliary body            | Front of eye; muscle that supports lens/iris                                  |
| Aqueous/vitreous humour | Middle of eye; watery/gelatinous fluid, low/high protein content              |
| Retina                  | Back of eye; contains photoreceptors/neurons                                  |
| Fovea                   | Back of eye; comprised primarily of cones; clearest vision                    |
| Optic disk              | Back of eye; blind spot due to lack of photoreceptors                         |
| Optic nerve             | Back of eye; nerves that connect to midbrain/thalamus                         |
| Midbrain                | Controls eye movement; pupil size                                             |
| Thalamus                | Processes shades/colour/motion/depth                                          |
## Inventory

| Type                           | Count (millions) |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| Rod (primary phototransducers) | 125              |
| Cone                           | 5                |
| Bipolar                        | 5                |
| Ganglion                       | 1                |
**Phototransduction**: light hyperpolarizes rod cells, causing electrochemical signal propagation along a synapse to the brain.
**Rhodopsin**: a protein that changes conformation when struck by light (specifically *retinal* in rhodopsin), triggering the cascade. Accounts for 95% of all disk proteins.
