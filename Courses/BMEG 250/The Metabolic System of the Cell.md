**Key creators of complexity**:
- Nucleic acids
- Proteins
- Glycans
- Lipids

# Information transfer
Information is stored in the **genome** as DNA. DNA can self-replicate or be transformed into RNA (**transcription**). This RNA is then read to create proteins, through **translation**.

## DNA
A double helix.
Is unwound by **helicase**, which splits the double-strands. This allows DNA polymerase to form a complex with DNA for replication, or RNA polymerase for transcription.

## Difference between nucleic acids
One alcohol group. In DNA, there is an oxygen missing at the 2-carbon.

**3' and 5' end**: Refers to how DNA chains itself at the 3-carbon and 5-carbon. There is polarity!
**1-carbon**: Where the nucleobase binds

## Binding of nucleobase to sugar
**Glycosidic bond**: dehydration bond at 1-carbon.
**Phosphoester bond**: phosphate surrounded by =O and 2 -OH. Occurs at 3' or 5'

## Energy of DNA
>[!The Only Rule of Chemistry]
>Everything will try to take a state of least energy

As per the above rule, aromatic rings desire to "stack" to share their electron cloud, allowing them to reduce their energy. This relies on "aromatic $pi - pi$ backbonding".
