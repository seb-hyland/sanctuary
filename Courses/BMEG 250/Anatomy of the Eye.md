# Sclera
- Opaque, avascular covering
- Preserves eye shape

# Cornea
- Transparent, avascular covering
- Refracts light

# Choroid
- Blood and lymphatic vessels of the eye
- Supplies nutrients and oxygen to the retina

# Lens
- Transparent, made of collagen
- Refracts light

# Iris
- Forms aperture or pupil
- Smooth muscle tissue

# Ciliary body
- Smooth muscle
- Supports lens/iris

# Aqueous humour
- Watery liquid
- Low protein content

# Vitreous humour
- Gelatinous fluid
- High protein content

# Retina
- Comprises of photoreceptors and neurons

# Fovea
- Mostly comprised of cones
- Clearest vision

# Optic disc
- Blind spot
- No photoreceptors

# Optic nerve
- Connects the eye to the midbrain and thalamus

# Midbrain
- Image processing centre of the brain (1)
- Controls eye movement and pupil size

# Thalamus
- Image processing centre of the brain (2)
- Processes shades, colours, motion, depth

# Cell inventory

| Type           | Count |
| -------------- | ----- |
| Ganglion cells | 1 M   |
| Bipolar cells  | 5 M   |
| Cone cells     | 5 M   |
| Rod cells      | 125 M |

>[!Concept]
> When modelling a complex system, it is often beneficial to **simplify it by making assumptions**.
> For instance, for the above system, it may be prudent to focus on modelling rod cells, as they are the overwhelming cell type in terms of count.
> To fully model the system, a much more complex mathematical model is necessary.
